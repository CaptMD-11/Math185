\textbf{Problem 5.}
\\
Show that if $f(z)$ has an essential singularity at $z_0$, then $e^{f(z)}$ also has an essential singularity at $z_0$.
\\
\\
\textit{Solution:} We aim to show that $e^{f(z)}$ has neither a pole nor a removable singularity at $z_0$. Put $g(z) = e^{f(z)}$. First, suppose $g$ has a pole at $z_0$. We utilize the following result.

\renewcommand{\thecustomThm}{1}
\begin{theorem}
$z_0$ is a pole of $f$ if and only if there is a punctured disc $D_r(z_0)\backslash\{z_0\}$ on which $|f|$ is bounded below and unbounded above. 
\end{theorem}

Then, by Theorem 1, there is a punctured disc $D_r(z_0)\backslash\{z_0\}$ on which $f$ is bounded above and unbounded below. Choose a point $z_1 \in D_r(z_0)\backslash\{z_0\}$ with $|z_0 - z_1|$ sufficiently small. Then, since Thus, $z_0$ is not a pole of $g$. Now, suppose $g$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$. From the hint, we have that a singularity $z_0$ is removable if and only if $|f|$ is bounded on some $D_r(z_0)$. By assumption, $|g|$ is bounded on some $D_r(z_0)$. Then,
